Project Description:
The Guess the Word Game is a fun and interactive mini-project where players test their knowledge of programming languages. Players are shown a randomly generated letter from a programming language's name (e.g., "P" for Python) and provided with multiple-choice options. They must choose the correct language based on the hint.

The game is designed to be visually engaging, responsive, and user-friendly, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Technologies Used:
HTML:
Structure of the game (buttons, display area, etc.).

CSS:
Styling for an attractive and user-friendly design (themes, animations).

JavaScript:
Game logic, dynamic content, and interactivity (random letter generation).
